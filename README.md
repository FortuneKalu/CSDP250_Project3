# CSDP250_Project3
Program Description
This program creates a Binary Search Tree (BST) from 35 unique random numbers generated in the range 0-100.
It then performs and displays the results of three types of tree traversals:
- Pre-order Traversal: Root → Left → Right
- In-order Traversal: Left → Root → Right (sorted order for BST)
- Post-order Traversal: Left → Right → Root

The program ensures that all generated numbers are unique and utilizes a linked list to store and print the traversal results.
